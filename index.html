        <h2>Web Designing</h2>
        <p>Web designer. Is it just us, or does that have a nice ring to it? And it’s not just a catchy title—learning web design can lead to an exciting and fascinating career, especially for a creative problem-solver like you.

                But just the idea of getting started in web design can be overwhelming. Maybe you’re secretly thinking: what do web designers do? Or maybe even: what is web design? (Yes, we were there at one point, too!)
   </p>
   <p>  
        It might seems obvious that you need design knowledge to be a web designer, but visual design focuses on digital products, so it might be different than what you expect. In this case, design principles are what determine the look and feel of a site. They can range from proportions to typography, to grid systems, to color theory. In other words: visual design is your chance to dig into creating mood boards and type hierarchy and experimenting with web fonts and color palettes.
        Here come those funny abbreviations! UX stands for user experience, or how people feel (calm, frustrated, etc.)<span> when they use a website. Above all else, UX is about approaching your designs from a user-first perspective—how can you design a website that helps them get exactly what they need?

        To do that, you’ll research your users and create “personas” (profiles of imaginary ideal users). </span>You’ll lay out the pages and content with a site map. You’ll figure out the path users take on your site in user flows. (For example, do they always click straight through to social media? Or are they just looking for contact information?) And you’ll build wireframes to sketch out the key parts of each webpage. All of these components are essential to practicing user experience design.
        
        Pro tip: Still confused about the difference between all these types of design skills, and which one you should learn first? We recently broke down the difference between visual design and web or website design, as well as UX design and graphic design if you want more clarity!
